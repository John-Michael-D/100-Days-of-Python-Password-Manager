This is a password manager program that stores and updates a locally-hosted SavedPasswords.txt file containing the user's account credentials for specified websites. The program is able to generate a completely random password for the user. The user is also able to specify the amount of letters, numbers, and special symbols they want in their password. Before writing the specified website, email/username, and password to SavedPasswords.txt, the program launches a new window asking the user to confirm if they truly want to save the information they just entered. If the user attempts to use the program to save information to SavedPasswords.txt while leaving any fields blank, then the program will generate an error message.
