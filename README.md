This is a password manager program that stores and updates a locally-hosted SavedPasswords.json file containing the user's account credentials for specified websites. The program is able to generate a completely random password for the user. The user is also able to specify the amount of letters, numbers, and special symbols they want in their password. Before writing the specified website, email/username, and password to SavedPasswords.json, the program launches a new window asking the user to confirm if they truly want to save the information they just entered. If the user attempts to use the program to save information to SavedPasswords.json while leaving any fields blank, then the program will generate an error message.

The program also features exception handling in the event SavedPasswords.json doesn't exist or is empty of information. The program also includes a feature allowing the user to search SavedPasswords.json for their credentials pertaining to a given website.
